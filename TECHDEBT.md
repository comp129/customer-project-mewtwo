**Technical Debt:**

```We will be using the JavaFX library and the JavaFX Scene Builder,
to write some of the code revolving around building the GUI/Window 
of the application.```

```We will also be implementing GitHub Actions for continuous integration
management of our repository. We will be developing unit tests, so that the
code that is pushed is tested to run.```

```We are using gradle for SDK management in this project using the Eclipse IDE.```
